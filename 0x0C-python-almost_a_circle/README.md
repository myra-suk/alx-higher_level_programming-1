# Python - Almost a circle

In this project I learnt about:
* Import
* Exceptions
* Class
* Private Attribute
* Getter/setter
* Class method
* Static method
* Inheritance
* Unittest
* Read/write file
* args and kwargs
* Serialization/ Deserialization
* Java Script Object Notation

## Learning Objectives
```
* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* What is *args and how to use it
* What is **kwargs and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function
```

### Tasks
* **1. Base class**
	* [base.py](./base.py): Write a first Class Base
	```
	Class Base:
	* private class attribute __nb_objects = 0
	* class constructor: def __init__(self, id=None)::
        	* if id is not None, assign the public instance attribute id with this argument value - you can assume id is an integer and you donâ€™t need to test the type of it
        	* otherwise, increment __nb_objects and assign the new value to the public instance attribute id
	```
